<h1>About me </h1>
<p>I am an experienced web developer with a passion for learning and writing clean code. I take pride in the work that I deliver and always strive to adhere to best practices.</p>

<p>I am happiest building software that delivers value quickly, using modern techniques and principles, responding to change I enjoy working closely with stakeholders to get fast feedback.</p>

<p>From all the skills I have learnt I would have to say the area I enjoy the most is php and Ruby. Keeping ahead with the constantly evolving plugins, libraries and frameworks make it an exciting challenge. The most recent skill I have been learning has been test driven development and I hope to develop these skills further in my new position.</p>

<p>I have also recently spent a lot more time on my projects involved with responsive designs, developing sites that look good on any device and liaising with designers so that it can be made certain that any wireframes/designs are possible before getting to the development stage.</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>My currently-ongoing senior project <a href="#" target="__blank">Budget Sudan</a> and <a href="http://budget.go.ug" target="__blank">Budget Uganda</a>  Working as a <strong>Full stack Developer</strong></p>.
